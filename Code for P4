# python script for retrieving log files, determining total number of requests, and getting requests in a 6 month time period
# By Lauren, Linda, Diego, and Harley


#How many requests were made on each day? 
#How many requests were made on a week-by-week basis? Per month?
#What percentage of the requests were not successful (any 4xx status code)?
#What percentage of the requests were redirected elsewhere (any 3xx codes)?
#What was the most-requested file?
#What was the least-requested file?
